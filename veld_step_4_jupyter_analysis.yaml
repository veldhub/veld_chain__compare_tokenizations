    description: "This chain compares the two enriched TEI XML files which were the output of 
      xmlanntools and teitok-tools. The comparison is done by aggregating and counting the various 
      occurrences of grammatical metadata, structured by universal dependencies. This chain 
      launches an interactive jupyter notebook for easy replication of these count statistics. 
      After exceuting this chain, the notebook can be reached at http://localhost:8888/ ."
